## :eyeglasses: Project Introduction

**Best Movies** is my defense project for the **Front-End** course at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/ "SoftUni") (September-December 2022).

------------

## :pencil2: Overview

This application has been created solely for educational purposes.

**Best Movies** is an online platform where everyone can find the favourite movie, because it is filled with the best rating movies all over the world. Anyone who is registered can upload a movie to the app if the movie rating is over 8.0 on IMDB. Ð¢hat's why every movie before being uploaded goes through the approval of the admin. The initial dataset is taken from JSON file with the top 100 movies in IMDB.
